# Containers and Reproducible Builds

## Learning Objectives

- Launch Docker containers and access/execute programs on them
- Create/customize a Dockerfile to build a basic custom container

## Before Lecture

1) Sign up for an account at
  [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)

2) Install Docker to your machine.

- If you have Linux, MacOS Sierra or newer or Windows 10 Pro, install
  [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

- If you have older MacOS, Windows 10 Home, or older Windows, install
  [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview/)

- If you're unable to download or run Docker locally you can use [Docker Playground](labs.play-with-docker.com) for today's assignment. (We'll be using it during the guided project)

## Live Lecture Task

See [guided-project.md](https://github.com/BloomInstituteOfTechnology/DS-Unit-3-Sprint-1-Software-Engineering/blob/main/module3-containers-and-reproducible-builds/guided-project.md)

## Assignment

See [assignment.md](https://github.com/BloomInstituteOfTechnology/DS-Unit-3-Sprint-1-Software-Engineering/blob/main/module3-containers-and-reproducible-builds/assignment.md)

## Stretch Goal

1) Install docker on your machine and get a container running locally:

- If you have Linux, MacOS Sierra or newer or Windows 10 Pro, install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- If you have older MacOS, Windows 10 Home, or older Windows, install [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview/)

2) If you pushed your package to PyPi try to install and run the code from your `lambdata` package inside a Docker container.


## What should I submit to Canvas?

On Canvas please turn in your `Dockerfile`.

## Resources

- If your local installation isn't working, you can use the [Play with Docker
Classroom](https://training.play-with-docker.com/) - a Docker Hub account will
let you try Docker and spin up containers from your browser. They are
*temporary* (will go away when you leave the page), and editing the `Dockerfile`
will be a bit cumbersome, but we'll show how to do this in class.

- The [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) is extremely
thorough and worth checking out.

- [Docker commands](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/docker/) that we can run inside of a container.

- For a particular stretch goal, explore [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), a powerful approach to
combining containers (e.g. you can run a local webapp and database together).

- Explore [Hands-On Machine Learning in Docker](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml/tree/master/docker),
a prebuilt Docker container with all sorts of DS/ML goodies. By using Docker you
can get up and running with sophisticated systems remarkably quickly.

- Want to better understand the difference between VMs ("heavy") and containers
("light")? [This blog post](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/vm-vs-containers/)
highlights and summarizes the benefits and use cases of both.

Here are some other walkthroughs of Docker that have been given at BloomTech, should you want to go deeper on this subject:
